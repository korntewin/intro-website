## 2. üî•Early Days at ![KBTG logo](https://www.kbtg.tech/images/logo.svg)

My journey began at **KBTG**, where I spent **1.5 years** as a Machine Learning Engineer. My primary responsibility was to develop an application for analyzing bank statements. Sounds straightforward, right? Well, not quite. We were dealing with **20 million persons' bank statements**, totaling multiple terabytes of data. The challenge? Identifying income and salary information accurately, even amidst fraudulent transactions.

### The Complexity of Math Models

One of the most exciting aspects was working with a complex mathematical model‚Äî**wavelet analysis**‚Äîto identify salaries. This involved diving deep into the intricacies of signal processing and pattern recognition. But that wasn't all; we also had to tackle super complex business logic to identify income patterns regardless of fraudulent activities.

## 3. üöâ Next Stop: Thinking Machines

After my stint at KBTG, I joined **Thinking Machines**, a dynamic tech consultancy focused on AI and data platforms. Here, I've been responsible for developing NLP (Natural Language Processing) machine learning models to extract valuable information from a large number of documents for **Stock Exchange Thailand (SET)**.

### The Hybrid Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is hybrid, combining **AWS on-cloud** and the Stock Exchange Thailand's on-premise system. We leverage **AWS EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) as our main computation infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### The NLP Model

Our NLP model is a powerful ensemble of:

1. **Class-based TFIDF**: Leveraging term frequency-inverse document frequency to extract relevant features.
2. **Gradient Boosting Trees**: An ensemble of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatsBoost for robust predictions.
3. **Regular Expressions**: Cleaning and extracting data patterns.
4. **Nearest Neighbor Search**: Query nearest vectors using Exact Nearest Neighbor algorithm -- **BallTree**

## 4. üìñ Academic Background

Before diving into industry work, I pursued my Master's in Electrical Engineering at **Chulalongkorn University**, specializing in Power Systems. My research focused on optimizing battery energy storage systems and demand response using quadratic programming and augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimization.

After graduating, I landed my first job as a **power system engineer** at [GPSC](https://www.gpscgroup.com/th/home) around 2020. At that time, data science was booming in Thailand, piquing my interest and making me consider a career switch! I dedicated my evenings to studying Software Engineering and Machine Learning. Eventually, I transitioned to a software-house startup company called [Blockfint](https://www.blockfint.com/) as a Business Analyst before successfully switching to the role of a **Machine Learning Engineer** at KBTG. Woohoo!


## 5. The Role of a Machine Learning Engineer

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Thinking Machines, my primary responsibility is to build large, scalable solutions for AI problems. I collaborate closely with cross functional team both internal and external, developing own ML model, and transforming their research into robust systems capable of handling massive amounts of data.

My work involves diverse approaches:
- Leveraging cloud solutions for processing embarrassingly parallel data problems.
- Developing custom business logic algorithms to speed up computations.
- Developing Machine Learning model to solve business problem.
- Reducing processing time from years to days, hours, or even minutes‚Äîall while staying within budget constraints.

## Conclusion

My journey has been exhilarating‚Äîa blend of theory, practical challenges, and continuous learning. At Thinking Machines, I have many opportunities to improve myself and develop various AI solutions both in engineering and ML!
