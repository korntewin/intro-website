Hello there! I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** at <a href="https://thinkingmachin.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thinking Machines</a> with a passion for technology and innovation. My interests span across several exciting areas:

1. **ðŸ¤– Machine Learning**: As an ML enthusiast, I explore cutting-edge algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning architectures. Solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches excites me. 

2. **ðŸ¦¾ IoT (Internet of Things)**: I find the convergence of physical devices and digital technologies fascinating. The ability to connect everyday objects to the internet opens up endless possibilities for automation, data collection, and smart decision-making. Please follow my project at <a href="https://yolo.crypto-bot-gcp.trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this web application</a> for Object Detection with YOLOv8 rendering on client-side (your browser) using Rust's WebAssembly!

3. **Î» Functional Programming & Big Data**: I believe that functional programming paradigms can lead to more robust, maintainable, and scalable software. The elegance of immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative code resonates with me. Furthermore, the Functional Programming Patterns makes the **distributed programming** easy! The abstraction of developing single-cpu programming and distributed computing programming over 1,000 CPU cores are the same!


## Why This Website?

My intention behind developing this website was twofold:

1. **Skill Improvement**: I wanted to enhance my programming skills by diving into the world of web development. **React** and **Rust's WebAssembly** caught my attention due to their performance benefits and versatility.

2. **Exploring New Horizons**: The web is a dynamic space where creativity meets technology. By building this site, I aim to explore new tools, frameworks, and techniques while sharing my journey with others.
