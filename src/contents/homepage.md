Hello there! I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es/) with a passion for technology and innovation. My interests span across several exciting areas:

1. **Machine Learning**: As an ML enthusiast, I explore cutting-edge algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning architectures. Solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches excites me. Please follow my project at [this website for Object Detection with YOLOv8 rendering on client-side using Rust's WebAssembly](https://yolo.crypto-bot-gcp.trade)!

2. **IoT (Internet of Things)**: I find the convergence of physical devices and digital technologies fascinating. The ability to connect everyday objects to the internet opens up endless possibilities for automation, data collection, and smart decision-making.

3. **Functional Programming**: I believe that functional programming paradigms can lead to more robust, maintainable, and scalable software. The elegance of immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative code resonates with me.


## Why This Website?

My intention behind developing this website was twofold:

1. **Skill Improvement**: I wanted to enhance my programming skills by diving into the world of web development. **React** and **Rust's WebAssembly** caught my attention due to their performance benefits and versatility.

2. **Exploring New Horizons**: The web is a dynamic space where creativity meets technology. By building this site, I aim to explore new tools, frameworks, and techniques while sharing my journey with others.
